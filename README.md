It's 90% an internal app, though we ocassionaly share property pages with clients, or on listings.

2. Ensure you have the correct version of ruby installed (we recommend using asdf or rbenv). Check .tool-versions for details.
3. Run `bundle install` to install the gems
4. Run `rails test` to ensure all tests are passing
5. Run `rails s` to start the server
